A simple visualization for Theorem 3.1 in my [master's thesis](https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/handle/1974/8096).

The thesis proves that under certain constraints, that a network of agents who have a numerical opinion on a subject and who communicate sufficiently often, will 'agree' infintely often over an infinite time horizon. 

In the animation, you can see the opinions of 150 agents change. You will also notice that they stay relatively grouped together. Especially interesting is when one agent 'wanders off' but then eventually comes back to the fold.
